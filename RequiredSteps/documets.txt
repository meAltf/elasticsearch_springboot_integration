1. Disable auto index creation:
spring.elasticsearch.index.auto-create: false

2. Create index manually (ONE TIME):
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/products \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}'

3. Check:
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v

4. Put data in elasticsearch
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/products \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "MacBook Air M1",
  "description": "Apple laptop",
  "price": 99999
}'

5. Check data now | This proves Docker ES is actually storing data
curl http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty

6. After adding kibana check data visually
http://localhost:5601 -> under management -> dev tools
